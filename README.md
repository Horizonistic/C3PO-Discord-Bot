## A For-Fun Discord Bot
I made this bot to do some fun, basic stuff for a server.  It's nothing fancy but it's been tons of fun to work on.

I have a file called botinfo.py with one line: `token = "[BOT TOKEN]"`.  This is the only thing that needs to be provided for it to work.  It also creates a folder called `data` with subfolders `[guild.id]` for each server it is run in.
